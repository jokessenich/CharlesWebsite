        <h1> About </h1>
        <h2>Charles Rencountre</h2>
        <p>
            Charles Rencountre is a master sculptor who has worked in the materials of stone, wod, metal and now primarily in concrete. He is a 
            member of the Sicangu people who are from the Lower Brule reservation in what is South Dakota in the United States today.

            As a young man, Charles inherited wood and stone from his grandfather, a traditional pipe carver. Charles soon realized he was adept with Pipestone.

            Charles is a self-taught sculptor who was inspired by the grat European masters like Da Vinci and Michelangelo to make life-size figures.
            He rendered the human form using geometric equations, just as they had.

            In the last decade, Charles went back to school and graduated as the valedictorian of the Institute of American Indian Arts in 2015.
            As a sculptor and community oriented artist, he includes many mediums to reflect issues and stories pertinent to Native, Indigenous and World communities.

            Through MOCNA (Museum of Contemporary NativeArt Museum) in the fall of 2014, working closely with its curators, Ryan Rice and Candice Hopkins,
            and fellow artist Alicia Marie Rencountre-Da Silva, he co-designed and moderated the Shedding Skin symposium.
